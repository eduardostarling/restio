    A representation of a remote object model in a Transaction object.

    BaseModel is an abstract class that should be extended to represent models incoming
    from or outgoing to a remote REST API.

    Models can exist independently from Transactions but contain an internal state that
    indicates the status of the model within the current context. The Transactions are
    responsible to control this state. Also, each model contains a set of control
    attributes that indicate which fields are watched by restio internals. By default,
    all Field descriptors in the model will become field attributes. Fields declared
    with pk=True will be used by restio to optimize the caching of the models in a
    Transaction.

    Models that change over time will contain an internal dictionary with the latest
    know persistent value of each field. This is done to guarantee fast rollback of the
    values when the Transaction is invalid, and to also indicate which values might
    have changed within the transaction scope. If a field is modified directly, the
    model will intercept the change and save the older value into the persistent
    dictionary until `_persist` is called. During a `_rollback` call, however, the
    stored values are re-assigned to their original attributes. Each attribute change
    will also dispatch an update event so that the transaction is aware of changes and
    manages the model's internal state accordingly. The persistent dictionary (through
    the helper method `is_field_modified`) can also be used by DAO's to verify which
    values where updated prior to sending a request through the REST API, thus allowing
    for proper optimization and minimizing chances of conflicting changes on the remote
    object.

    All models automatically generate a random internal UUID when created. This UUID is
    used internally for comparison purposes, and externally as an identity. Although
    this attribute is not explicitly set as private, it should never be modified.
